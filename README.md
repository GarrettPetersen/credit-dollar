# Credit Dollar

This project is intended to create a new type of algostable based on uncollateralized loans. The protocol lends Credit Dollars (CUSD) into existence when the credit dollar is above peg. When CUSD is below peg, new funds are not lent out, and funds are removed from circulation by users repaying their loans.
